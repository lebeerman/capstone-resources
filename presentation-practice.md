* Your first practice will be on Monday, March 19. Then we will run through them again on March 21, 23, 26, and 27.
	* You will need to be in the room for your advisory group's practice, but we don't mind if you work during this time.
* Be prepared with some kind of slide deck on Monday. It does not need to be the final version, you will have lots of rounds of revisions. 
	* Slide decks in the past have included: 
    	* intro/about me slide
        * problem statement slide
        * demo holder
 		* tech notes
		* challenges you overcame
		* future roadmap
    * For any slides where you don't have anything to show (eg, demo), put wireframe, mockups, or even just a blank placeholder slide. 
* Be ready to present as if you did have a full slide deck. In place of a demo, talk about what functionality you want to show from your app. 
* We will be giving you as much feedback as we possibly can. This is in the interest of making sure you have the best possible presentation come showcase day. If, come the 27th, you have not put together a project and presentation that displays your talents and the level of professionalism we expect from our students, we will not clear you to present.
